## Description

Congruit is a lightweight configuration management and automation tool. It is written in Go but works through Bash. It manages shell scripts you created to configure your Linux platforms.

## Quick Examples

* Do worksplace test
```

## Concepts
The main concepts of Congruit are

* Stockroom repository
* Works
* Places
* Workplaces

## Stockroom
The Stockroom is the main repository that describes your platform. Congruit reads the stockroom and does things.

## Place
A place is a shell script that must return 0. You should be in a right place to do a work.
Example:

Is this Linux server a Centos 7?

```
[ ! -e /etc/redhat-release ] && exit 1
cat /etc/redhat-release | grep "Centos Linux release 7.*"
```

## Work
Work is a shell script that installs and configures programs or runs Docker containers like in the following example:

```
docker run --rm -p 8888:8080 tomcat:latest &> /dev/null &
```

## Workplace
Workplaces are the union between works and places and are JSON file.

Example:

```
[
  {
   "places": ["debian","screen_is_not_installed"],
   "works": ["screen_package_apt"]
  },
  {
   "places": ["centos7","screen_is_not_installed"],
   "works": ["screen_package_yum"]
  }
]
```
the workplace is able to decide which is the correct strategy to install software.
Congruit executes places and, if they return 0, it does works.

## Run Workplaces

**-workplaces test,test2**

```
./congruit -gitrepo https://github.com/Congruit/example-stockroom.git -workplaces test,test2
```

## Run Workplace Remotely

Start a remote Congruit:

```
congruit -debug -friend -token foobar -debug -gitrepo https://github.com/Congruit/example-stockroom.git  -ssl_cert /vagrant/insecure-domain.crt -ssl_key /vagrant/insecure-domain.key
```

Start remotely a workplace using:

```
curl https://192.168.50.4:8443/hello  --header "Token:foobar" --header "Workplace:test"
```


## Run Multiple Workplaces Remotely

Start a remote Congruit:

```
congruit -debug -friend -token foobar -debug -gitrepo https://github.com/Congruit/example-stockroom.git  -ssl_cert /vagrant/insecure-domain.crt -ssl_key /vagrant/insecure-domain.key
```

Start remotely multiple workplace using:

```
curl https://192.168.50.4:8443/hello  --header "Token:foobar" --header "Workplaces:test,test2"
```

## Docker Cluster

Congruit manages cluster through **supervisor and friend mode**

You can configure light Docker clusters as described in the following example.

1. Start Docker01 and Docker02 using Vagrant

**leave WORKPLACES_ENABLED empty**

```
vagrant up Docker01
vagrant up Docker02

vagrant provision Docker01
vagrant provision Docker02

vagrant status
Docker01                  running (virtualbox)
Docker02                  running (virtualbox)
```
Congruit starts and waits for commands sent by a cluster controller.

```
==> Docker02: Running provisioner: shell...
    Docker02: Running: inline script
==> Docker02: Running provisioner: shell...
    Docker02: Running: inline script
==> Docker02: Running provisioner: shell...
    Docker02: Running: inline script
==> Docker02:                          _ _
==> Docker02:  ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ _ _|_| |_
==> Docker02: |  _| . |   | . |  _| | | |  _|
==> Docker02: |___|___|_|_|_  |_| |___|_|_|
==> Docker02:             |___|
==> Docker02: Version: 1.0.0
==> Docker02: 2017/01/04 17:11:06 There are no workplaces to apply... Doing nothing...
==> Docker02: 2017/01/04 17:11:06 Extecuted works: 0
```

2. Start dockers from your workstation:

```
./congruit -gitrepo https://github.com/Congruit/stockroom-docker-clu-controller.git -supervisor  -debug

```

Parameters:

* -supervisor => Runs congruit in supervisor mode.

* -friend => Runs congruit in friend mode. A Congruit instance receives remote commands to execute workplace

* -token => authentication tocken for security

* -stockroom-dir=stockroom-docker-clu-controller/ => custom stockroom for a cluster controller

Used works are like this:

```
curl https://192.168.50.4:8443/hello  --header "Token:foobar" --header "Workplace:tomcat-docker"
curl https://192.168.50.5:8443/hello  --header "Token:foobar" --header "Workplace:tomcat-docker"
```

## Build your workplace
1. Create your stockroom. I would like create a public repository with common and useful workplaces. For now you can take a look at https://github.com/Congruit/example-stockroom

2. You need to describe your places. Example:
  * is this server running a specific Linux distribution?
  * are there particular configuration files, installed software, environment variables that describe the role or the functionality of this server?
  * places are executed before works... You can copy files which contain environment variables that can be used by works.
  Put places in stockroom/places/ folder

3. Create works. Put the scripts in stockroom/works. Works install software, get configuration file from a repository, manage Docker containers ecc..

4. Create workplaces in stockroom/workplaces. Try to make them usable in more environments and follow this example:

Workplaces are array of hashes
```
[
  {
   "places": ["is_linux", "is_frontend","is_apache_not_istalled"],
   "works": ["install_apache"]
  },

  {
   "places": ["is_linux", "is_frontend", "has_additionl_vhost"],
   "works": ["additional_vhost","restart_apache"]
  },

  {
   "places": ["is_production"],
   "works": ["do_backup"]
  }

]
```

## Try Congruit With Vagrant

* List all virtual machine in current Vagrant project

```
eugenio@local:[~/WORK/GO/src/congruit]: vagrant status
Current machine states:

Centos7                   running (virtualbox)
```

* Provision and test your workplaces

```
export WORKPLACES_ENABLED=install_screen
vagrant provision Centos7
```

Remember to set WORKPLACES_ENABLED (example: WORKPLACES_ENABLED=do_this,do_this2,do_foobar) in order to execute workplaces

Example of Vagrant's output:

```
==> Centos7:                          _ _
==> Centos7:  ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ _ _|_| |_
